The results:

Size of each function:
populatearray(): 149
copyarray(): 83
bubbleSort(): 183
insertionSort(): 192
quickSort(): 98
swap(): 45

Address where each function is located (in hexadecimal):
populatearray(): 4009ba
copyarray(): 400967
bubbleSort(): a7c
insertionSort(): 400b33
quickSort(): 400bf3
swap(): 400a4f

Name and entry point for the entire program:
name- alpha-bin, entry point = 0x400590

Locations and names of subroutines from “standard libraries” such as stdio or stdlib that are linked with your file:
name- fscanf() location: 000000602018
name- fopen() location: 000000602040

The locations and sizes of the data sections used by your program:

name- mainarray[] size- 40000 location- 602080
name- MAX_SIZE(int) size- 4 location 400e28  

recompiling the program using the -O option:

Size of each function:
populatearray(): 101
copyarray(): 37
bubbleSort(): 115
insertionSort(): 75
quickSort(): 96
swap(): 9

Address where each function is located (in hexadecimal):
populatearray(): 4005e9
copyarray(): 4005c4
bubbleSort(): 40089d
insertionSort(): 400790
quickSort(): 400831
swap(): 400894

Name and entry point for the entire program:
name- alpha-bin, entry point = 0x4004e0

Locations and names of subroutines from “standard libraries” such as stdio or stdlib that are$
name- fscanf() location: 6011e0
name- fopen() location: 6011e8

The locations and sizes of the data sections used by your program:

name- mainarray[] size- 40000 location- 601240
name- MAX_SIZE(int) size- 4 location 400a80

Note:
I have noticed that in the optomized program with the -0 command, the size of the functions
are slightly smaller. This makes the program as a whole smaller.
