This repository contains all my CS course work at the University of Idaho as an undergraduate.It will be periodically
updated with new assignments as I work through getting my degree. The intention of this repository is to share my work
with colleagues or potential employers. It is password protected and compressed to prevent other Computer Science students
from accessing it and potentially cheating. Contact me for the password.

Most of the code here is in either C or C++. All code may be compiled using a command line and the GCC Compiler for
C Programs or the G++ Compiler for C++ Programs.

To compile a C File – 

gcc connorsprogram.c -o connorsprogram

For a C++ File – 

g++ connorsprogram.cpp -o connorsprogram
