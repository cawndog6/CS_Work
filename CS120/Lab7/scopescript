Main 1: a = 1 b = 5 g = 4 x = 0
a was declared on line 7 and assigned the value 1 on line 7.
b was declared on line 8 and assigned the value 5 on line 8.
g was declared on line 5 and assigned the value 4 on line 5.
x was declared on line 9 and assigned the value 0 on line 9.

Main 2: a = 7 b = 5 g = 10 x = 0
a was declared on line 14 and assigned the value 7 on line 14.
b was declared on line 8 and assigned the value 5 on line 8.
g was delcared on line 15 and assigned the value 10 on line 15.
x was declared on line 9 and assigned the value 0 on line 9.

Function1: a = -4 x = 1 g = 6
a was declared on line 31 and assigned the value x-y on line 32.
x was declared on line 30 and assigned the value of a(1) on line 30.
g was declared on line 33 and assigned the value x+y on line 33.
   
Main 3: a = 1 b = 2 g = 6 x = -4
a was declared on line 7 and assigned the value 1 on line 7.
b was declared on line 8 and assigned the value a+g(2) on line 34. It was passed into function1 by reference as variable y.
g was declared on line 5 and assigned the value x+y(6) on line 33.
x was declared on line 9 and assigned the value a(-4) on line 38.

Function1: a = 1 x = 2 g = 3
a was declared on line 31 and assigned the value x-y(1) on line 32.
x was declared on line 30. It was assigned the value of b(2), which was passed in by value on line 46.
g was declared on line 5 and assigned the value x+y(3) on line 33.

Main 4: a = 1 b = 4 g = 4 x = 1
a was declared on line 7 and assigned the value 1 on line 7.
b was declared on line 8 and assiged the value a+g(4) on line 34. b was passed by reference into function2 on line 24, and then passed by reference into function 1 on line 46.
g was declared on line 5 and assigned the value temp*x(4) on line 46.
x was declared on line 9 and assigned the value of temp on line 24. To get this, x was set = function2(a,b). function2(a,b) returned temp.

---Robot Problems---
I think one potential problem with the compass on the robot would be magnetic field interference from metals on the robots that are magnetic. This could make the robot turn the wrong way.
Another issue may be with the accuracy of GPS sensor. If its a few feet off, the robot may not know exactly where it is. Also, if there is poor lighting, the camera wont be able to see the objects in its path.
